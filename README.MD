Stack Control

*[Try it online!](https://creastive.github.io/StackControl?code=%5B1+2+3%5D%282mul%29each)*  

Stack Control is a stack-based programming language created by me. This is a Rust remake of the [original C# version](https://github.com/CREAsTIVE/StackControl-Deprecated).  
There's no specific purpose for this language â€“ I just created it for fun. It was inspired by [Uiua](https://www.uiua.org/) and other stack-based languages.  

### How it works  
*Documentation coming soon. For now, you can see the [description of the old version](https://github.com/CREAsTIVE/StackControl-Deprecated/blob/master/README.md)*  

### Dev build  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CREAsTIVE/StackControl.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the shell project:  
   ```bash
   cd stack-control/stack-control-shell
   ```
3. Run with Cargo:  
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```  
*Requires Unicode support in your terminal/console.*
